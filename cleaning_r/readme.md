# Cleaning data in R

[Wikipedia's entry on dirty data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_data) defines it as:

> “Dirty data, also known as rogue data, are inaccurate, incomplete or inconsistent data, especially in a computer system or database.”

We can also add data that is **inconvenient or incompatible** - areas where R, and the `tidyverse` in particular, come in very useful.

This folder contains notebooks with some techniques in R for working with dirty data.
